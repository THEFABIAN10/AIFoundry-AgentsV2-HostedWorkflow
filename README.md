# Microsoft Agent Framework: Hosting Agentic Workflows in Azure AI Foundry
This repo provides a practical implementation of _Hosted Workflows_ using the **Microsoft Agent Framework**'s Python SDK. Unlike local workflows, hosted workflows are deployed directly to Azure AI Foundry, allowing them to be managed, versioned and executed within the Azure ecosystem.

> [!WARNING]
> To successfully run these notebooks, you must have an **Azure AI Foundry** project and **AI model deployment**. Please ensure you have the following environment variables set up in your system:
> | Environment Variable             | Description                                                                     |
> | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | `AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | The endpoint URL for your Azure AI Foundry project.                             |
> | `AZURE_FOUNDRY_GPT_MODEL`        | The name of the model deployment to be used by the agent, e.g., _gpt-4.1-mini_. |

## Use-Case Scenario: Code Review
This sample demonstrates a _Code Review_ workflow involving two specialised agents:
- **Developer Agent**: writes code to solve problems and may occasionally introduce bugs,
- **Reviewer Agent**: checks the code for style and correctness.

The workflow continues in a loop until the Reviewer provides the `approved` keyword, at which point the final solution is delivered then to the user.

## Code Sample: YAML Definition
The workflow logic is defined in `CodeReview.yaml` file, that describes the triggers, variables and the sequence of agent invocations.

### 1.1 Workflow Trigger
The workflow is initialised using the `OnConversationStart` trigger, that captures the user's input into a local variable (`Local.LatestMessage`) as the starting context for the agents.

``` YAML
kind: workflow
trigger:
  kind: OnConversationStart
  id: trigger_wf
  actions:
    - kind: SetVariable
      id: init_latest
      variable: Local.LatestMessage
      value: =UserMessage(System.LastMessageText)
```

### 1.2 Agent Invocation
The logic utilises the `InvokeAzureAgent` action to call specific agents registered in Azure AI Foundry.
- **DeveloperAgent**: receives the initial problem or previous feedback to generate code,
- **ReviewerAgent**: analyses the developer's output to provide feedback or approval,

Both agents map their outputs back to `Local.LatestMessage`, for the conversation state to persist across turns.

``` YAML
- kind: InvokeAzureAgent
  id: invoke_developer
  agent:
    name: DeveloperAgent
  conversationId: =System.ConversationId
  input:
    messages: =Local.LatestMessage
  output:
    messages: Local.LatestMessage
    autoSend: true
```

### 1.3 Conditions and Looping
To manage the _code review_ interactions, the workflow utilises a `ConditionGroup` logic.
- **Approval Check**: A condition searches for the string "_approved_" within the reviewer's last message.
- **Termination**: If approved, the workflow sends the final activity and ends the conversation.
- **Looping**: If not approved, a `GotoAction` redirects the flow back to the `invoke_developer` step.

``` YAML
- kind: ConditionGroup
  id: check_approved
  conditions:
    - id: if_approved
      condition: =!IsBlank(Find("approved", Lower(Last(Local.LatestMessage).Text)))
      actions:
        - kind: EndConversation
  elseActions:
    - kind: GotoAction
      id: loop_back
      actionId: invoke_developer
```

## Code Sample: Python Script
The `hosted_workflow.py` script is your _deployment engine_. It utilises the `AIProjectClient` to register both the individual **agents** and the orchestration **workflow** in your Azure AI Foundry project.

### 2.1 Registering Agents
Agents are created as _versions_ in the new Azure AI Foundry UI. This allows you to define their persona once and reuse then specific versions in the target agentic workflows.

``` Python
agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
    agent_name="<YOUR_AGENT_NAME>",
    definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
        model=model,
        instructions="<YOUR_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS>"
    ),
)
```

### 2.2 Registering the Workflow
The YAML definition is uploaded to Azure AI Foundry as a `WorkflowAgentDefinition`. By registering the workflow this way, you make it "hosted" and enable it being triggered within _AI Foundry UI_ or via _API calls_ to the project endpoint.

``` Python
workflow_agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
    agent_name=workflow_definition["name"],
    definition=WorkflowAgentDefinition(workflow=workflow_yaml),
    description=workflow_definition["description"],
)
```

### 2.3 Client Initialisation
To interact with Azure AI Foundry, the Python script initialises an `AIProjectClient` using your Azure AI Foundry project endpoint and `AzureCliCredential`. This client serves as the primary interface for managing agentic resources in AI Foundry.

``` Python
project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=project_endpoint,
    credential=AzureCliCredential()
)
```

## Deployment of Hosted Workflow
To deploy the workflow to your Azure AI Foundry project, run the following command. Ensure you have authenticated via the Azure CLI (az login) first.

Bash

# Install dependencies
pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity pyyaml

# Run the deployment script
python hosted_workflow.py CodeReview.yaml

## Execution in Azure AI Foundry
Once deployed, you can manage and visualize your agents and workflows directly in the Azure AI Foundry portal:

Agents Section: View the DeveloperAgent and ReviewerAgent, inspect their instructions, and test them individually.

Workflows Section: Find the CodeReviewWorkflow. You can view the YAML structure and monitor execution logs.

Traceability: Each run generates a unique ConversationId, allowing you to trace the multi-turn interaction between the developer and reviewer agents.
